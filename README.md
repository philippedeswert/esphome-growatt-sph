Esphome definitions for Growatt Wifi-X stick with SPH1000-TL3-BH-UP

This is a simple yaml to flash the Growatt Wifi-X stick with esphome to replace 
the slowly updating cloud so you are actually able to use Home Assistant.

As I needed to do a lot of digging and could not find a working one for my SPH I hope
you will find this works for you if you find yourself in my situation.

With adjusted uart ports this probably will also work with a serial converter and
regular esp32 connected on one of the RS485 ports.
